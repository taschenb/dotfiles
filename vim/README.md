#vim

For some time now I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for most work I do. Neovim is a refactored Vim with some new features and worth checking out.

This means that my vimrc doesn't necessarily represent the current state of my configuration anymore.
For now I intend to maintain it by comparing both configurations from time to time.
